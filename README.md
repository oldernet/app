# Oldernet Explorer
## ⚠️ OLDERNET EXPLORER (OE) IS FREE!!! If you paid a penny for OE, YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED AND SHOULD ISSUE A CHARGEBACK WITH YOUR BANK, IF POSSIBLE! If you have been scammed, message me so I can issue a copyright takedown.
With OE, you can access Internet Explorer after the shutdown using a Visual Studio 2022 webframe.
## Download
⚠️ These are the **ONLY** official downloads for OE! All other apps are unofficial.

First thing's first, select a download provider to download Oldernet Explorer...

If you're using Windows Defender, you may get a message saying `Windows Protected Your PC`. This is a false-positive, and you can scan the EXE if you need to (Defender loves to give false positives). To go around this, click the `More Info` link. A button will then appear labeled `Run Anyways`, click this. You shouldn't need to do this again.
